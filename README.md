# pycftools

This library provides access to all cftools api methods. It is a kind of wrapper for all methods.

https://developer.cftools.cloud/documentation/data-api

For each library method. A verbose docstring has been written.

## Installation

```
pip install pycftools
```



## Basic usage:

```python
import pycftools

cfapi = pycftools.CfToolsApi(app_id='',
                             app_secret='', game_identifier='',
                             ip='', game_port='',
                             server_id='',
                             server_banlist_id='')
```

## Constructor arguments

```python
Class CfToolsApi used to access various cftools api methods.
The main use, getting access to api.
The ability to automate some processes, and getting access to the application from outside.

:param app_id: Application Id from https://developer.cftools.cloud/applications
:type app_id: str
:param app_secret: Application secret from https://developer.cftools.cloud/applications
:type app_secret: str
:param game_identifier: Game_identifier is needed to create server id.
:type game_identifier: str
:param ip: Ipv4 is needed to create server id.
:type ip: str
:param game_port: Game_port is needed to create server id.
:type game_port: str
:param server_api_id: Server_api_id this is the global server identifier and it can be found in the server API settings.
:type server_api_id: str
:param server_banlist_id: Server_banlist_id is global banlist identifier, it can be found in ban-manager https://app.cftools.cloud/ban-manager - see for Banlist ID.
:type server_banlist_id: str
:param auth_token_filename: Auth_token_filename this is the filename var for auth token file.
:type auth_token_filename: str
:param pycftools_debug: This is the variable for enabling debug outputs from the program.
:type pycftools_debug: bool
:param timestamp_delta: This is the time offset delta when the token in the file needs to be updated. By default, the value is set to half a day - 43200. UNIXTIMESTAMP
:type timestamp_delta: int
```


# Methods

The library provides all the methods from the cftools documentation. 
Request parameters are completely identical to those presented in the documentation.

#### All methods of the class return response objects, this is done for the convenience of further control.
#### You need to work with them as with ordinary responses to requests. json(), text, status_code, etc...
## If you don't know how to work with response objects. Read the documentation for the requests module.

## Authentication

```python
cfapi = pycftools.CfToolsApi(--->... < ---)
# Before working with methods, you need to get a token
# The library itself will add the token to the session headers
# All you need to do is create an instance of the class with all the parameters.
```

## Auth

##After version 0.2.7, you no longer need to call this method yourself. 
##The library will do everything by itself when you call the method you need.

```python
check_register()

This method is needed to check if we have an up-to-date authorization token.
It checks if there is a file with a token inside.
If such is found, it checks the relevance of the token and loads if everything is correct.

Note:
    Saving a token to a file is the simplest thing that came to my mind.
    Perhaps there is some kind of security threat from this.
    Write to issues on github to discuss :)

    Saving the token to a file makes it possible not to request a new token -
    every time after the object is re-created.
    Moreover, there is a delay of 2 requests per minute.

:return: return True if all auth moments is OK. else False.
:rtype: bool
```
